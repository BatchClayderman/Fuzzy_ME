# Fuzzy-ME

This is the official implementation of the Fuzzy-ME cryptography scheme in the Java programming language based on the JPBC library, which is the baseline of the [AA-IB-ME cryptography scheme](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/AA-IB-ME). 

Two ZIP packages are provided to help users reconstruct the projects in IDEA and Eclipse. 

This repository is a part of the [cryptography schemes](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/Cryptography-Schemes). 

As this version utilized outdated application programming interfaces (APIs), the repository will **no longer be maintained**.
